# Advancing the Goose Framework: Detailed Feature Proposals

This document outlines detailed conceptual designs for a suite of advanced features proposed to enhance the capabilities of the Goose agentic framework. These proposals cover areas ranging from more sophisticated reasoning and planning to continuous learning, multi-agent collaboration, and deeper self-understanding. Each feature is described with a focus on potential data structures, core mechanisms, module definitions, and integration points within the existing Goose architecture.

## I. Advanced Reasoning & Strategic Planning

### Hierarchical Planning
*   **Data Structures**:
    *   `StrategicGoal`: `{ id: String, description: String, status: Enum(Pending, Active, Achieved, Failed), tactical_plans: Vec<TacticalPlanID> }`
    *   `TacticalPlan`: `{ id: String, strategic_goal_id: String, description: String, status: Enum, operational_steps: Vec<OperationalStepID>, preconditions: Vec<Condition>, effects: Vec<Condition> }`
    *   `OperationalStep`: `{ id: String, tactical_plan_id: String, description: String, tool_name: String, tool_parameters: Value, status: Enum, expected_outcome: String, actual_outcome: Option<String>, sub_steps: Option<Vec<OperationalStepID>> }`
    *   `Condition`: `{ description: String, is_met: bool, source: Enum(WorldState, ToolEffect) }`
*   **Mechanism**:
    *   The `Agent` initiates by defining `StrategicGoal`(s).
    *   A dedicated planning module (or the LLM itself) generates `TacticalPlan`(s) for each strategic goal.
    *   Each `TacticalPlan` is further broken down into `OperationalStep`(s).
    *   The `Agent`'s `reply` loop executes these steps, updates their status, and verifies associated conditions.
    *   The LLM is prompted at each hierarchical level to generate the subsequent level or to adjust plans based on execution outcomes and changing conditions.

### Uncertainty Modeling
*   **Representation**:
    *   Each `Condition` within plans can have an associated `confidence_score: f32` (ranging from 0.0 to 1.0).
    *   `OperationalStep` outcomes, if non-deterministic, can be modeled as a probability distribution: `possible_outcomes: Vec<{state_description: String, probability: f32, utility_score: f32}>`.
*   **Updating Beliefs**:
    *   **Bayesian Updates**: Confidence in `Condition`s can be updated using Bayesian inference based on tool outcomes and environmental observations.
    *   **MCTS for Planning**: For selecting among alternative `TacticalPlan`s or `OperationalStep`s, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) can be employed. Nodes represent plan states, and simulations (potentially using LLM predictions for outcomes) estimate the probability of achieving the `StrategicGoal`, guided by utility scores.
*   **Integration**:
    *   A new `UncertaintyManager` module would be responsible for maintaining these belief states (confidence scores, probability distributions).
    *   This module would provide this uncertainty information to the planning module and to the LLM during prompt construction to inform decision-making.

### Causal Inference Engine
*   **Module**: `CausalModelManager`.
*   **Data Structure**:
    *   A directed acyclic graph (DAG) where nodes are state variables or events, and edges represent causal links.
    *   Schema: `{ nodes: Vec<{id: String, description: String}>, edges: Vec<{source_id: String, target_id: String, relationship_type: Enum(Probabilistic, Functional), parameters: Value (e.g., CPTs, function definitions)}> }`.
*   **Building the Model**:
    *   Populated from domain knowledge provided via prompts or a structured knowledge base.
    *   Potentially learn relationships from observed `(action, pre_state, post_state)` tuples gathered during tool usage (a complex research area).
*   **Querying**:
    *   The `Agent` can query the model (e.g., "What is P(Y|do(X))?" using Pearl's do-calculus concepts, or simpler conditional probabilities).
    *   The LLM can be prompted with relevant segments of the causal graph when making decisions, especially for diagnosing issues or predicting side effects of actions.
*   **Integration**: The `CausalModelManager` would be accessible by the `Agent` and potentially by tools that require understanding of causal effects.

### Analogical Reasoning Module
*   **Module**: `AnalogyEngine`.
*   **Data Structure (Case Base)**:
    *   `StoredSolutionCase`: `{ problem_description_embedding: Vec<f32>, problem_description_text: String, strategic_goal: StrategicGoal, successful_plan_trace: Vec<OperationalStep>, success_metrics: Value }`.
*   **Mechanism**:
    1.  **Storage**: When a `StrategicGoal` is successfully achieved with high metrics, the `Agent` (or a background process) prepares and stores a `StoredSolutionCase`. The `problem_description_embedding` is generated using an embedding model.
    2.  **Retrieval**: For a new `StrategicGoal`, its description is embedded. The `AnalogyEngine` searches the case base for cases with high cosine similarity between embeddings.
    3.  **Adaptation**: The `successful_plan_trace`(s) from the most similar past case(s) are provided to the LLM as part of the planning prompt, instructing it to adapt the retrieved plan to the new problem's specifics.
*   **Integration**: The `AnalogyEngine` is invoked by the `Agent` during the initial planning phase for a new goal.

### Dynamic Replanning Hooks
*   **Triggers for Replanning**:
    1.  **Significant State Change**: Detected by an `EnvironmentMonitor` (e.g., critical variable change beyond a threshold).
    2.  **Deviation from Expected Progress**: `OperationalStep`s significantly exceeding `expected_duration` or `expected_resource_consumption`.
    3.  **Milestone Failure/Invalidation**: Failure of a `TacticalPlan` or key `OperationalStep`, or a previously met `Condition` becoming unmet.
    4.  **Opportunity Detection**: Identification of a new, more efficient path or a critical opportunity by the `EnvironmentMonitor` or a specialized tool.
    5.  **User Interruption**: Explicit user command to replan.
*   **Integration**:
    *   The `Agent`'s main `reply` loop (or a dedicated supervisor loop) checks these triggers after each `OperationalStep` or periodically.
    *   A replan involves re-invoking the hierarchical planning process (potentially from the current `TacticalPlan` or `StrategicGoal` level) with the updated world state, causal model understanding, and remaining goals. The LLM is prompted with the reason for the replan.

## II. Continuous Learning & Adaptation

### Interaction Feedback Loop
*   **Structured Log Format**:
    *   Each `AgentEvent` and `ToolCallResult` is logged with a common wrapper:
        ```json
        {
          "log_id": "uuid",
          "session_id": "session_uuid",
          "user_id": "user_uuid_or_null",
          "timestamp_utc": "iso_8601_datetime",
          "event_type": "AgentEvent::Message | ToolCallResult",
          "event_data": { /* event payload */ },
          "feedback": {
            "user_rating_stars": "Option<u8 (1-5)>",
            "correction_suggestion_text": "Option<String>",
            "is_error_report": "bool",
            "feedback_source": "Enum(ExplicitUI, Command, ImplicitSentiment, ToolInternal)",
            "tags": "Vec<String>"
          }
        }
        ```
*   **Feedback Collection**:
    *   **Explicit UI**: Buttons for ratings, error reporting, correction suggestions.
    *   **Commands**: E.g., `/feedback log_id <id> rating 5`.
    *   **Implicit Sentiment Analysis**: User replies analyzed for sentiment to infer satisfaction.
    *   **Tool Internal Feedback**: Tools emit structured error codes/reasons.
*   **`FeedbackStore`**:
    *   A dedicated database (e.g., SQL table, document collection) to persist structured feedback, linked to interaction logs via `log_id`. Optimized for querying feedback across interactions.

### Automated Prompt Optimization
*   **`PromptVariantManager`**:
    *   **Storage**: Database table: `(prompt_type, variant_id, prompt_template_text, creation_date, performance_metrics: JSONB)`.
    *   `performance_metrics` include run counts, success rates, average token usage, user ratings, task duration.
*   **Learning Algorithm**:
    *   Multi-armed bandit or similar RL approach for each `prompt_type`.
    *   **Action**: Select a prompt variant.
    *   **Reward**: Composite score from task success, efficiency, and user feedback from `FeedbackStore`. Attributed back to the used variant.
*   **A/B Testing Framework**:
    *   Allows controlled testing of new prompt variants against current best versions. Users/sessions assigned to groups, performance tracked separately.
*   **Integration**: `Agent`'s `PromptManager` consults `PromptVariantManager` (and its learning algorithm) to select prompt templates.

### Knowledge Base (KB) Construction & Refinement
*   **Schema (Graph-based, e.g., Property Graph)**:
    *   **Nodes**: `Entity` (Person, File, etc.), `Concept`, `ToolDefinition`, `UserSession`, `InteractionLog`. Nodes have properties like `name`, `aliases`, `creation_date`, `confidence_score`.
    *   **Edges**: `USES_TOOL`, `MENTIONS_ENTITY`, `RELATED_TO_CONCEPT`, `SUB_EVENT_OF`, with properties like `source_interaction_id`, `confidence_score`.
*   **`KnowledgeExtractionService`**:
    *   A background service or agent step processing `Content` objects.
    *   Uses LLM/specialized models for Named Entity Recognition (NER), Relation Extraction (RE), concept mapping.
    *   Canonicalizes entities and generates proposed additions/updates to the KB graph with confidence scores.
*   **`KnowledgeStore`**:
    *   A graph database (e.g., Neo4j, AWS Neptune) to persist the KB.
*   **KB Update Protocol**:
    *   Rules for merging new information, handling conflicts (e.g., based on source reliability, recency, confidence), and pruning outdated/low-confidence data.
*   **Querying**:
    *   `Agent` issues structured queries (Cypher, SPARQL) or natural language (converted to queries) to the `KnowledgeStore` for context. Query results are injected into prompts.

### Online Model Fine-tuning Component (for Adapters/Specialized Models)
*   **Data Collection Pipeline**:
    *   Filters interaction logs from `FeedbackStore` for high-quality examples (successful tasks, user corrections).
    *   Transforms logs into structured training data (e.g., `(prompt, ideal_completion)` pairs for instruction fine-tuning).
*   **Adapter Training Module**:
    *   Focuses on lightweight, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) like LoRA or Prefix Tuning for a base LLM, or training smaller specialized models.
    *   Uses libraries like Hugging Face `transformers` `Trainer` and `peft`.
    *   Manages adapter versions and their association with base models.
*   **Infrastructure**:
    *   Requires a training environment (can be asynchronous/batched), potentially with GPU access.
    *   MLOps platform components for experiment tracking and model/adapter registry.
*   **Deployment & Integration**:
    *   `Provider` implementation modified to load PEFT adapters on top of a base model.
    *   `Agent` or `Config` can specify which adapter version to use.

### Cross-Session Learning Repository
*   **Centralized Storage**: Database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for structured data and object store (e.g., S3) for large artifacts.
*   **Artifacts Stored**:
    *   Optimized prompt variants from `PromptVariantManager`.
    *   Aggregated tool performance metrics (success rates, common failure modes) from `FeedbackStore`.
    *   Generalized patterns or rules derived from the `KnowledgeBase`.
    *   Trained model adapters from the fine-tuning component.
*   **Update Mechanism**: Regular batch processes or event-driven updates to this repository from agent instances/sessions.
*   **Access & Utilization**:
    *   Agents query this repository during initialization (e.g., `PromptManager` fetches best prompts) or at specific decision points (e.g., `ToolRouter` uses tool reliability scores).
    *   `Provider` loads appropriate fine-tuned adapters based on configuration from this repository.

## III. Deep Self-Understanding & Introspection

### Traceability & Explainability Logger
*   **`ReasoningTrace` Object**:
    *   Fields: `trace_id`, `decision_id`, `parent_decision_id`, `timestamp`, `decision_type` (e.g., "ToolSelection", "PlanGeneration"), `inputs` (sub-goal, available tools, context), `alternatives_considered`, `selected_alternative`, `justification_prompt_response` (LLM's justification if asked), `confidence_score`.
*   **Persistence**: Traces persisted to a searchable store (e.g., document database, specialized logging system like Elasticsearch or Jaeger if adaptable). Indexed by decision type, timestamp, session ID.
*   **Integration**: Agent's control loop instrumented to create and emit traces at significant decision points (LLM calls, tool dispatch).

### Confidence Scoring Module
*   **LLM Self-Assessment**:
    *   Modify `Provider::complete()` to optionally return `self_assessed_confidence: Option<f32>`.
    *   Achieved by prompting LLM to append a confidence score (e.g., "Confidence: X.X") or via a separate LLM call to assess its previous response.
*   **Tool Execution Confidence**:
    *   Derived from historical success rates of the tool in similar contexts, stored in the `CrossSessionLearningRepository`.
*   **Storage**: Scores stored in `ReasoningTrace.confidence_score_self_assessed` or `.confidence_score_derived`, and potentially in `FeedbackStore`.
*   **Usage**: Low confidence scores can trigger fallback behaviors (confirmation, seeking more info, alternative tools).

### Knowledge Gap Identification Mechanism
*   **Flagging**:
    *   Triggered by LLM expressing low confidence or missing information/tools.
    *   Repeated tool failures suggesting misunderstanding.
    *   Planning module unable to find a viable path.
*   **`KnowledgeGap` Entry Structure**:
    *   `{gap_id, session_id, timestamp_identified, description_by_llm, type_of_gap, context_at_identification, related_entities_in_kb, resolution_attempts: Vec<{action_taken, outcome}>, status: Enum(Open, Investigating, Resolved_Internally, Needs_User_Input, Needs_Developer_Review), resolution_details}`.
    *   Stored in a dedicated database.
*   **Process**:
    *   Agent creates `KnowledgeGap` entry.
    *   Can trigger sub-goals to resolve the gap (e.g., using search tools, querying KB).
    *   Unresolved gaps may escalate to user input or developer review.

### Metacognitive Prompting Strategies
*   **Implementation**: `PromptManager` maintains a library of metacognitive prompt snippets.
*   **Dynamic Insertion**: Snippets injected based on agent state or `ReasoningTrace` events. Examples:
    *   "Before selecting a tool, list top 3 candidates and pros/cons for each."
    *   "If plan confidence is <0.7, identify uncertainty sources."
    *   "Review previous action: Was outcome expected? If not, explain discrepancy and suggest updates."
*   **Output Handling**: LLM's responses to these prompts captured in `ReasoningTrace.justification_prompt_response`, influencing subsequent decisions or replanning.

## IV. Dynamic Tool & Capability Management

### Autonomous Tool Discovery (from Registries/Documentation)
*   **`ExternalToolRegistryManager`**: Interfaces with predefined external tool registries (API catalogs, OpenAPI spec lists).
*   **`ToolSpecificationParser`**: Extracts name, description, I/O schemas, auth from OpenAPI/Swagger specs or structured documentation (using parsing libraries and potentially LLM for less structured docs).
*   **`CandidateToolEvaluator`**: Uses LLM to assess relevance and safety of a newly discovered tool for the agent's goals and capabilities.
*   **Proposal Mechanism**: Vetted tools (parsed spec, evaluation) are queued. Approved tools lead to `ExtensionConfig` creation/update (e.g., for a generic HTTP wrapper extension), potentially requiring user confirmation.

### Automated Tool Scaffolding (for Simple Tools)
*   **Tool Scaffolding Prompt**: LLM generates basic MCP extension code (e.g., Python function with MCP client interactions) from a natural language description and I/O examples.
*   **`ScaffoldingEnvironment`**: Secure, isolated environment (e.g., Docker container) for minimal testing (syntax checks, basic execution) of generated code.
*   **Output & Review**: Generates candidate `ExtensionConfig` (e.g., Stdio type) and tool code, flagged as "Experimental - Human Review Required."

### Learned Tool Composition & Chaining
*   **`ToolChainPredictor`**:
    *   **Learning Phase (Offline/Batch)**: Analyzes `FeedbackStore`/`ReasoningTrace` for successful multi-tool sequences for specific task types. Stores as `LearnedToolChain`: `{chain_id, name, task_type_description, trigger_context_embedding, tools: Vec<{tool_name, parameter_mapping_rules}>, success_rate, avg_efficiency}`.
    *   **Prediction Phase (Online)**: Retrieves relevant chains based on new task/goal description embedding or type.
*   **Integration**: Proposed chains presented to LLM during planning ("For goal 'X', a successful chain is [A->B->C]. Adapt or use?"). LLM decides. Successful executions feedback into learning.

### Tool Self-Modification/Refinement (Limited Scope)
*   **`ToolParameterOptimizer`**:
    *   Learns optimal default values for pre-defined, safe-to-tune tool parameters (e.g., `max_results_for_web_search`) from `FeedbackStore` data (parameter values used vs. task success/efficiency).
    *   Uses simple optimization (e.g., Bayesian optimization, tracking average reward for discrete values).
*   **Update & A/B Testing**: Suggested optimal defaults stored in `CrossSessionLearningRepository`. Changes versioned and A/B tested before global rollout.
*   **Safety**: Excludes direct code modification by LLM; focuses on optimizing parameters of human-vetted tools.

## V. Collaborative Multi-Agent Systems

### Inter-Agent Communication Protocol
*   **Message Schemas (e.g., Protobuf or structured JSON)**:
    *   `Header`: `{ message_id, sender_agent_id, receiver_agent_id, timestamp_utc, message_type, protocol_version }`
    *   Types: `TaskOffer`, `TaskAcceptance`, `TaskRejection`, `TaskStatusUpdate`, `KnowledgeQuery`, `KnowledgeShare`, `ResourceRequest`, `ResourceRelease`. Each with specific payloads.
*   **Transport Mechanisms**:
    *   **gRPC**: For low-latency, direct agent-to-agent or agent-to-broker communication.
    *   **Message Queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka)**: For asynchronous, decoupled communication, task distribution, and persistent knowledge streams.

### Task Delegation & Brokering Module
*   **`TaskBroker` (Service or Specialized Agent)**:
    *   **Agent Registry**: Database of available agents, their capabilities (from `ExtensionManager` or `AgentProfile`), status, load, trust score.
    *   **Mechanism**:
        1.  Agents register/update profiles with `TaskBroker`.
        2.  Requester agent sends `TaskOffer` (task description, constraints, required capabilities) to `TaskBroker`.
        3.  `TaskBroker` matches offer against registry, forwards to candidate agents.
        4.  Candidates respond with `TaskAcceptance` or `TaskRejection`.
        5.  Requester confirms with one acceptor.
    *   Direct delegation possible if agents have prior knowledge of peers.

### Shared Knowledge Repository Interface
*   **API Endpoints or Subscription Model**: For agents to contribute to and query a shared `KnowledgeStore` (as defined in Continuous Learning).
    *   `POST /query` (accepts `KnowledgeQuery`, returns `KnowledgeShare`).
    *   `POST /contribute` (accepts `KnowledgeShare`).
*   **Versioning & Conflict Resolution**: Knowledge entries versioned. Conflicts handled by rejecting, storing with lower confidence, or triggering consensus.

### Distributed Planning & Consensus
*   **Process**:
    1.  `CoordinatingAgent` breaks down complex goals, offers "CollaborativePlanContribution" tasks.
    2.  Interested agents form a "planning swarm," exchange capabilities/perspectives (`KnowledgeShare`).
    3.  Iteratively build a shared `DistributedOperationalStep` plan.
*   **Consensus Algorithm** (for key steps, resource allocation, shared beliefs):
    *   Voting mechanism or simplified Raft/Paxos for critical decisions.
    *   "Propose and challenge" model for less critical items.
*   **Execution**: Agents execute assigned steps, send `TaskStatusUpdate` to coordinator and dependent peers.

## VI. Enhanced Robustness & Resilience

### Advanced Anomaly Detection
*   **`RuntimeMonitorService`**:
    *   Continuously analyzes `ReasoningTrace`, tool logs, resource usage.
    *   Employs statistical methods (SPC) and ML models (autoencoders, isolation forests) to detect anomalies (unexpected error rates, long execution times, atypical planning patterns).
    *   Flags anomalies with severity levels (`AnomalyEvent`).

### Automated Recovery Strategy Engine
*   **`RecoveryPolicyManager`**: Stores `RecoveryPolicy` objects: `{policy_id, triggering_anomaly_pattern, diagnostic_steps, recovery_actions_sequence}`.
*   **Mechanism**: Agent (or supervisor) receives `AnomalyEvent`, queries manager for matching policies. Executes diagnostics, then recovery actions (e.g., retry with backoff, switch tool, replan, escalate to user, trigger graceful degradation).

### Graceful Degradation Controller
*   **Activation**: Triggered by `RecoveryPolicyManager` or critical service/tool/model unavailability.
*   **`DegradationStrategy` Configuration**: Defines actions based on unavailable resource type.
    *   Actions: Switch to fallback LLM model, disable problematic extension, limit task scope, inform user, use cached knowledge only.
*   **Mechanism**: Identifies unavailable resource, matches strategy, executes corresponding actions.

### Dynamic Ethical Guardrail Enforcement
*   **`EthicalCheckModule`**: Invoked before critical actions (destructive operations, sensitive tool calls, external comms).
*   **`EthicalPolicySet`**: Configurable, version-controlled rules (pattern-based, embedding-based, LLM-based checks: "Is this action compliant with policy X?").
*   **Mechanism**: Evaluates proposed action against policies.
    *   **Outcome**: `Allow`, `Deny` (agent must replan/inform), or `RequiresConfirmation` (pause, send structured request to user).
    *   All checks and outcomes logged for audit.

## VII. Proactive Goal & Opportunity Management

### Event-Driven Goal Proposal
*   **`EnvironmentWatcherService`**: Monitors external event streams (emails, file changes, RSS, calendar). Parses into `ExternalEvent` format.
*   **`OpportunityDetector`**: Uses rules or LLM to score `ExternalEvent` relevance to agent's role/user interests and novelty. Generates `ProposedGoal` (with justification, suggested plan, urgency) if high.
*   **Integration**: `ProposedGoal`s queued for `Agent`. Agent presents to user or acts if pre-authorized.

### Proactive Information Gathering Scheduler
*   **`BackgroundScheduler`**: Manages `ScheduledInfoGatheringTask`s: `{task_id, goal_description, source_tool_name, tool_parameters_template, schedule_cron_expression}`.
*   **Creation**: Tasks created by user, by agent for `KnowledgeGap` resolution, or from `LongTermObjectiveTracker`.
*   **Execution**: Triggers tools per schedule, sends output to `KnowledgeExtractionService` for KB integration. Runs with lower priority.

### Long-Term Objective Tracker
*   **Data Structure**: `LongTermObjective`: `{objective_id, user_id, description_text: String, status: Enum(Active, Paused, Achieved, Abandoned), related_strategic_goals: Vec<StrategicGoalID>, progress_metrics: Value, last_review_utc}`.
*   **Mechanism**: Agent periodically reviews active objectives. Uses LLM to assess progress (querying KB/logs) and suggest new `StrategicGoal`s or `ScheduledInfoGatheringTask`s. Updates progress metrics.

## VIII. Rich Contextual Understanding

### Multi-Modal Information Processing Pipeline
*   **`InputPreprocessor`**: Accepts text, image, audio URLs/paths. For non-text, invokes specialized models (image captioning, speech-to-text) to convert to textual descriptions or structured data (`Content` objects).
*   **`MultiModalProvider` Interface Extension**: `Provider::complete` extended to accept `Content` items that can be `ImageURL`, `ImageData`, etc., for LLMs with direct multi-modal input support.
*   **Integration**: User input processed by `InputPreprocessor`. Resulting `Content` objects added to `Message` history. `PromptManager` formats for (potentially multi-modal) LLM.

### Persistent User Profile & Preference Model
*   **`UserProfileStore` (Database)**: Stores `UserID`, `ExplicitPreferences` (communication style, default paths), `InferredPreferences` (frequently used tools, common task patterns - from log analysis), `InteractionSummaries`, `CustomInstructions`.
*   **Mechanism**: Loaded at session start. `PromptManager` uses for tailoring prompts. `Agent` uses for personalizing behavior. Background job updates inferred preferences.

### Social & Emotional Context Analyzer (Advanced & Experimental)
*   **Module**: `SentimentEmotionAnalyzer`.
*   **Input**: User's textual input from `Message`.
*   **Processing**: Uses fine-tuned classifier or LLM prompting to detect sentiment (positive/negative/neutral), emotion (joy, anger, etc.), urgency.
*   **Output**: `SocialContextAnnotations`: `{sentiment_primary, sentiment_score, detected_emotions, urgency_level}`. Added to `Message` metadata.
*   **Integration**: `PromptManager` can include summary in prompts. `Agent` can adjust response tone, prioritize tasks, or ask clarifying questions based on analysis.
*   **Ethical Considerations**: High sensitivity. Accuracy challenges, potential for bias, transparency to user, avoid overreach. Use strictly to improve task-oriented communication.

## Conclusion

Implementing these advanced features would significantly elevate the Goose framework, transforming it into a highly intelligent, adaptable, robust, and potentially collaborative agentic system. Such advancements could enable Goose to tackle far more complex tasks, learn continuously from its experiences, interact more naturally and safely, and ultimately provide greater value to its users. This roadmap represents a long-term vision for creating a state-of-the-art AI agent.
